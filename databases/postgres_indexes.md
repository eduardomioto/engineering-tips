# PostgreSQL Index Types and Recommendations

PostgreSQL provides several types of indexes beyond B-Tree, each optimized for specific types of queries and data. Below is an overview of the available indexes and recommendations for when to use them.

---

## 1. B-Tree Index
- **Description:** Balanced tree structure; ideal for equality (`=`) and range queries (`<`, `>`, `BETWEEN`).
- **Use Case:** Default index type, suitable for most queries on scalar data types.
- **Recommendation:** Use for primary keys, unique constraints, and general-purpose indexes.

---

## 2. Hash Index
- **Description:** Uses a hash table internally; optimized for equality comparisons only.
- **Use Case:** Queries with `=` operator where range queries are not required.
- **Example:**
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_hash ON table_name USING hash(column);
  SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column = 'value';
  ```
- **Recommendation:** Rarely used because B-Tree often performs as well and supports more operations. Use only for very high-performance equality lookups on specific workloads.

---

## 3. GIN (Generalized Inverted Index)
- **Description:** Efficient for multi-valued data, such as arrays, JSONB, and full-text search.
- **Use Case:** 
  - Queries involving `@>`, `?`, `?|`, `&` operators on JSONB.
  - Full-text search.
  - Array operations.
- **Example:**
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_jsonb ON table_name USING gin(jsonb_column);
  SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE jsonb_column @> '{"key": "value"}';
  ```
- **Recommendation:** Use for full-text search or JSONB/array fields with complex queries.

---

## 4. GiST (Generalized Search Tree)
- **Description:** Flexible index type for data with complex relationships, such as geometric data or ranges.
- **Use Case:**
  - Spatial queries with PostGIS.
  - Range queries (e.g., `int4range`, `tsrange`).
  - Nearest-neighbor searches.
- **Example:**
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_gist ON table_name USING gist(geom);
  SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE geom && ST_MakeEnvelope(1, 1, 5, 5);
  ```
- **Recommendation:** Use for geometric or range-based data and nearest-neighbor searches.

---

## 5. SP-GiST (Space-Partitioned GiST)
- **Description:** Specialized for non-balanced, hierarchical data like quadtrees or prefix searches.
- **Use Case:**
  - Prefix queries (e.g., text search).
  - IP address lookups using `inet` type.
- **Example:**
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_spgist ON table_name USING spgist(ip_address_column);
  SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE ip_address_column << '192.168.0.0/24';
  ```
- **Recommendation:** Use for high-performance prefix or IP-based lookups.

---

## 6. BRIN (Block Range Index)
- **Description:** Lightweight index type that stores summary information about block ranges.
- **Use Case:**
  - Large, sequentially stored datasets (e.g., time-series data).
  - Queries that involve filtering large ranges of data.
- **Example:**
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_brin ON table_name USING brin(timestamp_column);
  SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE timestamp_column BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31';
  ```
- **Recommendation:** Use for very large, append-only datasets where disk space is a concern.

---

## 7. Partial Index
- **Description:** Index only a subset of rows that meet a specific condition.
- **Use Case:**
  - Queries with frequent filtering on specific conditions.
- **Example:**
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_partial ON table_name(column) WHERE status = 'active';
  SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE status = 'active' AND column = 'value';
  ```
- **Recommendation:** Use to save space and improve performance for queries with predictable filters.

---

## 8. Expression Index
- **Description:** Index based on the result of an expression or function.
- **Use Case:**
  - Queries involving computed values.
- **Example:**
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_expression ON table_name ((LOWER(column)));
  SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE LOWER(column) = 'value';
  ```
- **Recommendation:** Use for frequently computed values or case-insensitive searches.

---

## 9. Unique Index
- **Description:** Ensures all values in a column or combination of columns are unique.
- **Use Case:**
  - Enforcing uniqueness constraints.
- **Example:**
  ```sql
  CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_unique ON table_name(column);
  ```
- **Recommendation:** Use for primary keys and other columns requiring uniqueness.

---

## 10. Covering Index
- **Description:** Includes additional columns in the index to support index-only scans.
- **Use Case:**
  - Queries that can be satisfied entirely by the index without table access.
- **Example:**
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_covering ON table_name(column) INCLUDE (additional_column);
  ```
- **Recommendation:** Use to optimize frequently queried columns.

Choosing the right index depends on your data model, workload, and query patterns. Properly combining these indexes with query optimization can significantly improve PostgreSQL's performance.
