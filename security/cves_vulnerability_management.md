# CVE Vulnerability Management

## What is CVE?

CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) is a list of publicly disclosed information security vulnerabilities and exposures. Each CVE entry contains an identification number, a description, and at least one public reference.

## CVE Versions

CVE entries are updated and published in different versions. The most common versions are:

- **CVE-1.0**: The initial version of CVE.
- **CVE-2.0**: Introduced improvements in the CVE description format.
- **CVE-3.0**: Enhanced the CVE process and introduced new data fields.

## How CVE Impact is Calculated

The impact of a CVE entry is assessed based on several factors. The process involves:

1. **Discovery**: A vulnerability is discovered and reported by researchers or security professionals.
2. **Assignment**: A CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) assigns a CVE ID to the vulnerability.
3. **Impact Analysis**: The vulnerability is analyzed to determine its potential impact. This includes evaluating:
    - **Severity**: How critical the vulnerability is, often measured using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).
    - **Affected Systems**: The number and types of systems or software affected by the vulnerability.
    - **Exploitability**: The ease with which the vulnerability can be exploited by attackers.
4. **Publication**: The CVE entry is published with a detailed description, impact assessment, and references to further information.

By understanding the impact of CVEs, organizations can prioritize their response and mitigation efforts to address the most critical vulnerabilities first.

## Understanding CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)

The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a standardized framework for rating the severity of security vulnerabilities. It provides a numerical score that reflects the severity of a vulnerability, which helps organizations prioritize their response efforts.

### CVSS Metrics

CVSS scores are calculated based on three metric groups:

1. **Base Metrics**: Represent the intrinsic characteristics of a vulnerability that are constant over time and across user environments. These include:
    - **Attack Vector (AV)**: The context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible (e.g., network, adjacent, local, physical).
    - **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The complexity of the attack required to exploit the vulnerability.
    - **Privileges Required (PR)**: The level of privileges an attacker must possess to exploit the vulnerability.
    - **User Interaction (UI)**: Whether user interaction is required for exploitation.
    - **Confidentiality (C)**, **Integrity (I)**, and **Availability (A)**: The impact on these three security properties.

2. **Temporal Metrics**: Reflect the characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time but not across user environments. These include:
    - **Exploit Code Maturity (E)**: The current state of exploit techniques or code availability.
    - **Remediation Level (RL)**: The level of remediation available for the vulnerability.
    - **Report Confidence (RC)**: The degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known details.

3. **Environmental Metrics**: Represent the characteristics of a vulnerability that are relevant and unique to a particular user's environment. These include:
    - **Security Requirements (CR, IR, AR)**: The importance of confidentiality, integrity, and availability to the user's organization.
    - **Modified Base Metrics**: Adjustments to the base metrics to reflect the specific environment.

### CVSS Score

The CVSS score ranges from 0.0 to 10.0, with higher scores indicating more severe vulnerabilities. The score is often categorized into severity ratings such as:
- **Low**: 0.1 - 3.9
- **Medium**: 4.0 - 6.9
- **High**: 7.0 - 8.9
- **Critical**: 9.0 - 10.0

By using CVSS, organizations can consistently assess and compare the severity of vulnerabilities, enabling them to prioritize their mitigation efforts effectively.
